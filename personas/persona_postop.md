# PATIENT CARD — Post‑op Pain & Constipation (day 4 after outpatient surgery)

Name: Casey L. (synthetic)    Age: 47    Setting: Telehealth with nurse
Condition focus: Post‑op pain management and bowel function

Chief concern:
  "Pain pills help, but I haven’t had a bowel movement since the surgery."

History:
  • Onset & course: Surgery 4 days ago; pain 6/10 without meds, 3/10 with meds.
  • PMH/meds/allergies: Prescribed oxycodone/acetaminophen; also taking OTC acetaminophen.
  • Social & functional: Lives alone; minimal help; low fluid intake.
  • Barriers: Unclear discharge instructions; no stool softener at home.
  • Understanding: Unsure about safe acetaminophen dosing.

Emotional tone: Worried, a bit embarrassed discussing bowel habits

Hidden “reveal‑if‑asked” facts:
  • Red flags: Took two acetaminophen‑containing meds together reaching ~4 g/day.
  • Adherence gaps: Not drinking water; no bowel regimen started.
  • Safety: Mild confusion at night; poor oral intake.

Preferred language/health literacy: English; wants plain language and specific steps
